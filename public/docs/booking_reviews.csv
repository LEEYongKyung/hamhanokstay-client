This was an unexpected extra touch that we really appreciated.  The space is wonderful, with a large shared indoor kitchen/living area plus two separate bedrooms, each with their own bathroom, and a large private outdoor area.  The building is lovely - completely redone inside to feel all new and clean but with perfect historic accuracy regarding the detailing of structure.  This made it feel luxurious.  The towels were soft and fluffy and the bedding felt exceptionally fresh.  There were comfy cushions for extra seating.  The host provided complimentary bamboo tea, which was fun to enjoy.  The location is very nice, towards the north end of the historic area between Gyeongbokgung Palace and Changgyeonggung Palance, with lots of nice shops and cafes close by.","","9","10.0","10.0","10.0","10.0","10.0","10.0",""

Вечер провели во дворе, тут красивая подсветка, очень ламповая атмосфера.
